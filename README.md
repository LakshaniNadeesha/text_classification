# Text Classification Task

## Overview

classifying students' discussion forum posts based on Cognitive Presence in Community of Inquiry Framework. 

## Community of Inquiry Framework

The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework is a theoretical model developed by Garrison, Anderson, and Archer in the late 1990s. It aims to understand and facilitate successful online learning experiences by identifying and examining the key elements that contribute to meaningful and effective educational interactions. The framework is particularly relevant in the context of online and distance education, where building a sense of community and promoting cognitive engagement can be challenging.

The CoI framework consists of three main components, each representing a different type of presence:
1. **Social Presence:** Refers to the ability of participants in an online community to project themselves socially and emotionally, creating a sense of real interpersonal connection.
2. **Teaching Presence:** Focuses on the design, facilitation, and direction of the educational experience.
3. **Cognitive Presence:** This aspect centers around the development of critical thinking and deep understanding. 

### Categories of Cognitive Presence

1. **Triggering Event:** This is the initial phase where a problem, question, or challenge is presented to the participants. 
2. **Exploration:**  In this stage, participants actively explore and investigate the triggering event. This involves sharing diverse perspectives, raising questions, and seeking information.
3. **Integration:** The integration phase involves synthesizing information, connecting ideas, and constructing meaning collaboratively.
4. **Resolution:** The final stage is resolution, where participants collectively come to a conclusion or resolution regarding the triggering event.

## Objective

Develop an classification model that utilizes cognitive presence in students' discussion forum posts.
